## Core Principles

1. **Equity-Only Team**: Founders and early contributors work for equity, not salaries
2. **Free Tools First**: Use free tiers of all services (upgrade only when needed)
3. **Community-Driven**: Leverage community contributions and open-source
4. **Revenue-First**: Focus on generating revenue quickly, not perfection
5. **Grants & Partnerships**: Seek non-dilutive funding before equity rounds
